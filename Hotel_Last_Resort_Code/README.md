#1. About difference between the 'base.html' and 'mainPage.html'
#We design a communal front page ('mainPage.html') for consumers and employees to log in for a comprehensive overview of a hotel business. 
#Since this assignment just requires data management system for employees, the consumer log in page is not available for now.
#The 'login.html' is the login page specifially for employees, and the 'base.html' is the homepage after employees log into the system.

#2. About login process
#To realize the employee-log-in function, there's a log-in page specifically for employees, and we design a simple verification process. 
#We do not design a self-registration process for the username and password, because it should remain secure to hotel administration,
#and also it would be too complicated for this project. 
#Below is pre-inscribed usernames and passwords, please choose any pair you like to move through the web.
('E101', 'MarySmith', 'Pass!9021')
('E102', 'PettyRandal', 'Petty@123')
('E103', 'SussieNg', 'p@SS789')
('E104', 'WillLaForrest', 'Hotel@2025')
('E105', 'KerrySmith', 'Password#55')
#I directly copied it from file 'employeeInfo.sql', which is intended to store login information.

#3. About dashboard
#In our design, the dashboard is the homepage after employees log in to the database system.
#The employee can shift between navigation bar to check different sets of data.
